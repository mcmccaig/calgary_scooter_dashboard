# Calgary Mobility Demand Dashboard
This is a demand-based dashboard of the City of Calgary's electric scooter and bikes. The dashboard was completed entirely with Plotly.

### Data
Raw data can be found at the City of Calgary's [Open Data Portal](https://data.calgary.ca/). For the cleaned dataset used with the dashboard, a 10% sample of the dataset is supplied in the data folder but if you wish to use the full dataset feel free to contact me and I'll be happy to forward it to you.
